# Project Session Summary: MCP Server, Client, and FastAPI Integration

## Goal
Set up a minimal system for chatting with an LLM and MCP tools, using:
- An MCP server exposing tools/resources
- A FastAPI server serving the frontend
- A frontend (HTML/JS) that connects to the MCP server(s) via the MCP client

## Steps Taken

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created an MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) exposing an `echo` tool and a conversation history resource.
   - Created a FastAPI server (`server.py`) to serve static files and handle CORS.
   - Built a frontend (`static/index.html`) allowing users to connect to one or more MCP servers and chat with the LLM/tools.

2. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
   - Ensured the MCP server uses the official MCP Python SDK and exposes tools/resources as per protocol.
   - Verified that the MCP server runs as a standalone ASGI app (not mounted inside FastAPI).
   - Confirmed the frontend uses the MCP client SDK to connect to MCP servers.

3. **Troubleshooting**
   - Encountered errors when trying to mount the MCP server inside FastAPI; resolved by running MCP and FastAPI servers separately.
   - Diagnosed a persistent FastAPI error (`ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)`) as a version incompatibility between FastAPI and Starlette.
   - Solution: Downgraded Starlette to a version compatible with FastAPI 0.104.1 (`pip install 'starlette<0.37.0'`).

## Final Structure
- `mcp_server.py`: Standalone MCP server (port 8000)
- `server.py`: FastAPI static server (port 8001)
- `static/index.html`: Frontend using MCP client SDK
- `spec/first_spec.md`: This summary

## Next Steps
- Add more tools/resources to the MCP server as needed
- Expand frontend features or connect to additional MCP servers
- Ensure all package versions remain compatible
